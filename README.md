A multiplexer is a combinational circuit that has 2n input lines and a single output line. Simply, the multiplexer is a multi-input and single-output combinational circuit. The binary information is received from the input lines and directed to the output line. On the basis of the values of the selection lines, one of these data inputs will be connected to the output.
In the 16 to 1 multiplexer, there are total of 16 inputs, i.e., A0, A1, …, A16, 4 selection lines, i.e., S0, S1, S2, and S3 and single output, i.e., Y. On the basis of the combination of inputs that are present at the selection lines S0, S1, and S2, one of these 16 inputs will be connected to the output.
